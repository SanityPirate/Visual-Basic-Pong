# Visual Basic Pong

## Introduction

This was a final project I created in my senior year of highschool for my coding class. I decided to recreate Pong in Visual Basic
because it sounded fun and I thought it would be a good demonstration of what I learned in the class. It is also my first attempt
at a large project with any kind of coding.

This project helped me to define my coding style and also provided me a way to increase my proficiency at debugging. While the
project is far from bug-free, I am happy with how it turned out. It is a fully functional game created purely with Visual Basic.

## Future Improvements

If I ever decide to work on this again, there are two major things I would improve:
<ol>
<li>Adding difficulty levels to the computer (right now it is an unbeatable demigod)</li>
<li>Improving the movement of the ball (sometimes the angle it launches creates a poor gameplay experience)</li>
</ol>

As well as any additional bugfixes as necessary.
